#### `Programming and Data Science for Biology -- EEEB 4050`  
Spring 2018; Mondays: 2:10-4pm  
E3B Department Columbia University  
Instructor: Dr. Deren Eaton (de2356@columbia.edu)  
Teaching Assistant: Patrick McKenzie (p.mckenzie@columbia.edu)  

#### Office Hours:
Professor Eaton: Fridays, 10am-12pm in 1007 Schermerhorn Ext.  
Patrick McKenzie: Tuesdays 2-4pm in student room, Schermerhorn Ext.

#### Bulletin:  
Programming and Data Science for Biologists (PDSB) will introduce students to fundamental computational skills and concepts for working with large biological data sets. This will include learning core principles of at least one common programming language (Python), in addition to learning many tools for collaboration and version control (git, github), reproducible science (jupyter, rstudio), accessing large databases (HDF5, dask) and manipulating and visualizing data. Programmatic approaches are commonly used in biology but few biologists receive formal training in applying programming languages to these tasks. This course offers a deeper introduction to computational techniques and algorithms commonly applied to biological datasets, with particular attention to genomic analyses. 

#### Organization:  
The course meets on Mondays from 2:10-4pm. Each meeting will be a mix of lecture, in-class "active" learning, and group activities. In addition there will be a lot of work outside of clas to complete individual and group assignments, as well as a final project. In class activities will include group problem solving and code comparisons. All software and materials for the course are open access (available online for free) including assigned readings. An example session would include a lecture to introduce a general concept with examples from biological research, followed by a group active-learning exercise in which students implement the method applied to real datasets. 

#### Assignments:  
There will be code-based assignments for nearly every class period. These will require completing assignments outside of class in addition to performing "code reviews" of submissions by classmates based on assigned criteria. For example, check that their code works, that it follows proper style, and describe how the implementation differs from your own code. Both code and code reviews will be graded. A course project will be developed by each student and defended through a formal proposal process and later presented as a final project. Projects will be developed and published as open source code on github and evaluated on the basis of documentation, task-completion, and examples. 

#### Basis for grading:  
Grades will be composed of 13 assignments (35%) and code reviews (20%), a project proposal (5%), project presentation (5%), and project grade (20%), as well as on class participation (15%). 

#### Statement on Academic Integrity:  
Academic dishonesty is a serious offense and will not be tolerated in the class. Students are expected to reference sources appropriately in any work, including references to open source code found on-line, forum discussions, or third party software tools used in assignments or projects. Violation of the rules of academic integrity (e.g., plagiarism) from Columbia College or the Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences, will result in automatic failure of the course. Rules and consequences are outlined in Columbia College's Faculty Statement on Academic Integrity: [http://www.college.columbia.edu/faculty/resourcesforinstructors/academicintegrity/statement](http://www.college.columbia.edu/faculty/resourcesforinstructors/academicintegrity/statement).
